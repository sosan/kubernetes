![Google Cloud Self-Paced Labs](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/GMOHykaqmlTHiqEeQXTySaMXYPHeIvaqa2qHEzw6Occ%3D)

## Overview

For this Challenge Lab you must complete a series of tasks within a limited time period. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll be given a scenario and task - you figure out how to to complete it on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

To score 100% you must complete all tasks within the time period!

When you take a Challenge Lab, you will not be taught Google Cloud concepts. You'll need to use your advanced Compute Engine skills to assess how to build the solution to the challenge presented. This lab is only recommended for students who have Compute Engine skills. Are you up for the challenge?

### **Topics tested**

*   Create a Google Cloud SQL instance and create a database
*   Import a MySQL database into Cloud SQL
*   Reconfigure an application to use Cloud SQL instead of a local MySQL database

## Setup

#### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This Qwiklabs hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

#### What you need

To complete this lab, you need:

*   Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
*   Time to complete the lab.

**Note:** If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab.

**Note:** If you are using a Pixelbook, open an Incognito window to run this lab.

#### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud Console

1.  Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is a panel populated with the temporary credentials that you must use for this lab.

    ![Open Google Console](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/%2FtHp4GI5VSDyTtdqi3qDFtevuY014F88%2BFow%2FadnRgE%3D)

2.  Copy the username, and then click **Open Google Console**. The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the **Sign in** page.

    ![Sign in](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/VkUIAFY2xX3zoHgmWqYKccRLwFrR4BfARLd5ojmlbhs%3D)

    **_Tip:_** Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.

    <aside>If you see the **Choose an account** page, click **Use Another Account**. ![Choose an account](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/eQ6xPnPn13GjiJP3RWlHWwiMjhooHxTNvzfg1AL2WPw%3D)</aside>

3.  In the **Sign in** page, paste the username that you copied from the Connection Details panel. Then copy and paste the password.

    **_Important:_** You must use the credentials from the Connection Details panel. Do not use your Qwiklabs credentials. If you have your own Google Cloud account, do not use it for this lab (avoids incurring charges).

4.  Click through the subsequent pages:

    *   Accept the terms and conditions.
    *   Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
    *   Do not sign up for free trials.

After a few moments, the Cloud Console opens in this tab.

<aside>**Note:** You can view the menu with a list of Google Cloud Products and Services by clicking the **Navigation menu** at the top-left. ![Cloud Console Menu](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/9vT7xPlxoNP%2FPsK0J8j0ZPFB4HnnpaIJVCDByaBrSHg%3D)</aside>

### Activate Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.

In the Cloud Console, in the top right toolbar, click the **Activate Cloud Shell** button.

![Cloud Shell icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/vdY5e%2Fan9ZGXw5a%2FZMb1agpXhRGozsOadHURcR8thAQ%3D)

Click **Continue**.

![cloudshell_continue.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/lr3PBRjWIrJ%2BMQnE8kCkOnRQQVgJnWSg4UWk16f0s%2FA%3D)

It takes a few moments to provision and connect to the environment. When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your _PROJECT_ID_. For example:

![Cloud Shell Terminal](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/hmMK0W41Txk%2B20bQyuDP9g60vCdBajIS%2B52iI2f4bYk%3D)

`gcloud` is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

You can list the active account name with this command:

    gcloud auth list

(Output)

    Credentialed accounts:
     - <myaccount>@<mydomain>.com (active)

(Example output)

    Credentialed accounts:
     - google1623327_student@qwiklabs.net

You can list the project ID with this command:

    gcloud config list project

(Output)

    [core]
    project = <project_ID>

(Example output)

    [core]
    project = qwiklabs-gcp-44776a13dea667a6

<aside>For full documentation of `gcloud` see the [gcloud command-line tool overview](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).</aside>

## Challenge scenario

Your WordPress blog is running on a server that is no longer suitable. As the first part of a complete migration exercise, you are migrating the locally hosted database used by the blog to Cloud SQL.

The existing WordPress installation is installed in the `/var/www/html/wordpress` directory in the instance called `blog` that is already running in the lab. You can access the blog by opening a web browser and pointing to the external IP address of the blog instance.

The existing database for the blog is provided by MySQL running on the same server. The existing MySQL database is called `wordpress` and the user called **blogadmin** with password **Password1***, which provides full access to that database.

## Your challenge

You need to create a new Cloud SQL instance to host the migrated database. Once you have created the new database and configured it, you can then create a database dump of the existing database and import it into Cloud SQL. When the data has been migrated, you will then reconfigure the blog software to use the migrated database.

For this lab, the WordPress site configuration file is located here: `/var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php`.

To sum it all up, your challenge is to migrate the database to Cloud SQL and then reconfigure the application so that it no longer relies on the local MySQL database. Good luck!

<aside class="special">

**Note:** Your lab activity tracking score will initially report a score of 20 points because your blog is running. If you reconfigure the blog application to use Cloud SQL database successfully, those points will remain in your grand total.

If the database has been incorrectly migrated, the "blog is running" test will fail, reducing your score by 20 points.

</aside>

### **Tips and Tricks**

**Google Cloud SQL - How-To Guides**: The Cloud SQL documentation includes a set of [How-to guides](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/how-to) that provide guidance on how to create instances and databases, and how to connect applications to those databases.

**WordPress Installation and Migration:** The [WordPress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress) provides information on how to install, configure, and migrate WordPress sites. You will find the instructions on how to create and prepare databases for use with WordPress [here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Detailed_Instructions).

## Congratulations!

You have completed the challenge lab.
