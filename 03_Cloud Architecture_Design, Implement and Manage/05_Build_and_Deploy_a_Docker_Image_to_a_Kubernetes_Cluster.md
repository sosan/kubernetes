1 hour 30 minutes 7 Credits

## GSP304

![Google Cloud Self-Paced Labs](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/GMOHykaqmlTHiqEeQXTySaMXYPHeIvaqa2qHEzw6Occ%3D)

## Overview

For this Challenge Lab, you must complete a series of tasks within a limited time period. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll be given a scenario and task - you figure out how to complete it on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

To score 100% you must complete all tasks within the time period!

When you take a Challenge Lab, you will not be taught Google Cloud concepts. You'll need to use your advanced Compute Engine skills to assess how to build the solution to the challenge presented. This lab is only recommended for students who have Compute Engine skills. Are you up for the challenge?

### **Topics tested**

*   Build and tag a Docker Image of a sample application
*   Push the tagged image to Container Registry
*   Create a Kubernetes cluster
*   Deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster

## Setup

#### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click **Start Lab**, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This Qwiklabs hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

#### What you need

To complete this lab, you need:

*   Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
*   Time to complete the lab.

**Note:** If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab.

**Note:** If you are using a Pixelbook, open an Incognito window to run this lab.

#### How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud Console

1.  Click the **Start Lab** button. If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is a panel populated with the temporary credentials that you must use for this lab.

    ![Open Google Console](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/%2FtHp4GI5VSDyTtdqi3qDFtevuY014F88%2BFow%2FadnRgE%3D)

2.  Copy the username, and then click **Open Google Console**. The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the **Sign in** page.

    ![Sign in](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/VkUIAFY2xX3zoHgmWqYKccRLwFrR4BfARLd5ojmlbhs%3D)

    **_Tip:_** Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.

    <aside>If you see the **Choose an account** page, click **Use Another Account**. ![Choose an account](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/eQ6xPnPn13GjiJP3RWlHWwiMjhooHxTNvzfg1AL2WPw%3D)</aside>

3.  In the **Sign in** page, paste the username that you copied from the Connection Details panel. Then copy and paste the password.

    **_Important:_** You must use the credentials from the Connection Details panel. Do not use your Qwiklabs credentials. If you have your own Google Cloud account, do not use it for this lab (avoids incurring charges).

4.  Click through the subsequent pages:

    *   Accept the terms and conditions.
    *   Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
    *   Do not sign up for free trials.

After a few moments, the Cloud Console opens in this tab.

<aside>**Note:** You can view the menu with a list of Google Cloud Products and Services by clicking the **Navigation menu** at the top-left. ![Cloud Console Menu](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/9vT7xPlxoNP%2FPsK0J8j0ZPFB4HnnpaIJVCDByaBrSHg%3D)</aside>

### Activate Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.

In the Cloud Console, in the top right toolbar, click the **Activate Cloud Shell** button.

![Cloud Shell icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/vdY5e%2Fan9ZGXw5a%2FZMb1agpXhRGozsOadHURcR8thAQ%3D)

Click **Continue**.

![cloudshell_continue.png](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/lr3PBRjWIrJ%2BMQnE8kCkOnRQQVgJnWSg4UWk16f0s%2FA%3D)

It takes a few moments to provision and connect to the environment. When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your _PROJECT_ID_. For example:

![Cloud Shell Terminal](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/hmMK0W41Txk%2B20bQyuDP9g60vCdBajIS%2B52iI2f4bYk%3D)

`gcloud` is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

You can list the active account name with this command:

    gcloud auth list

(Output)

    Credentialed accounts:
     - <myaccount>@<mydomain>.com (active)

(Example output)

    Credentialed accounts:
     - google1623327_student@qwiklabs.net

You can list the project ID with this command:

    gcloud config list project

(Output)

    [core]
    project = <project_ID>

(Example output)

    [core]
    project = qwiklabs-gcp-44776a13dea667a6

<aside>For full documentation of `gcloud` see the [gcloud command-line tool overview](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).</aside>

## Challenge scenario

Your development team is interested in adopting a containerized microservices approach to application architecture. You need to test a sample application they have provided for you to make sure that that it can be deployed to a Google Kubernetes container. The development group provided a simple Go application called `echo-web` with a Dockerfile and the associated context that allows you to build a Docker image immediately.

## Your challenge

To test the deployment, you need to download the sample application, then build the Docker container image using a tag that allows it to be stored on the Container Registry. Once the image has been built, you'll push it out to the Container Registry before you can deploy it.

With the image prepared you can then create a Kubernetes cluster, then deploy the sample application to the cluster.

**Note:** In order to ensure accurate lab activity tracking you must use `echo-app` as the container repository image name, call your Kubernetes cluster `echo-cluster`, create the Kubernetes cluster in `us-central1-a` zone and use `echo-web` for the deployment name.

### Create a Kubernetes Cluster

Your test environment is limited in capacity, so you should limit the test Kubernetes cluster you are creating to just two `n1-standard-2` instances. You must call your cluster `echo-cluster`.

Click _Check my progress_ to verify the objective. <ql-activity-tracking step="1">A new Kubernetes cluster exists (zone: us-central1-a)</ql-activity-tracking>

### Build a tagged Docker Image

The sample application, including the Dockerfile and the application context files, are contained in an archive called `echo-web.tar.gz`. The archive has been copied to a Cloud Storage bucket belonging to your lab project called `gs://[PROJECT_ID].` You must deploy this with a tag called `v1.`

### Push the image to the Google Container Registry

Your organization has decided that it will always use the `gcr.io` Container Registry hostname for all projects. The sample application is a simple web application that reports some data describing the configuration of the system where the application is running. It is configured to use TCP port 8000 by default.

Click _Check my progress_ to verify the objective. <ql-activity-tracking step="2">An application image with a v1 tag has been pushed to the gcr.io repository</ql-activity-tracking>

### **Deploy the application to the Kubernetes Cluster**

Even though the application is configured to respond to HTTP requests on port 8000, you must configure the service to respond to normal web requests on port 80\. When configuring the cluster for your sample application, call your deployment `echo-web`.

Click _Check my progress_ to verify the objective. <ql-activity-tracking step="3">Check that an application has been deployed to the cluster</ql-activity-tracking>

Click _Check my progress_ to verify the objective. <ql-activity-tracking step="4">Test that a service exists that responds to requests like Echo-app</ql-activity-tracking>

## Troubleshooting

**Receiving a 504, Gateway timeout error:** This might just indicate that the application hasn't quite initialized yet, but it could also be caused by a mismatch between the default port that is set in the Dockerfile (TCP port 8000) and the choice of application port you configured when deploying the application image, or when you configured external access.

**Not receiving assessment score for the last three objectives:** This might just indicate that you have created your Kubernetes cluster in the different zone rather than `us-central1-a` zone which is expected in the lab.

## Congratulations!

You have completed the challenge lab.
